# IBM Applied Data Science Capstone: Final Project

**Topic:** Analyzing SpaceX Falcon 9 launches

In this project, I analyzed SpaceX launches and predicted whether it will be successful or not. I identified the factors affecting the success of rocket launches and applied machine learning models to predict the outcome. This final project was done through the following:
* Data Collection
* Web Scraping
* Data Wrangling
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Data Visualization
* Machine Learning

Some libraries / objects used are:
* Folium maps
* Plotly dash

This project was created as part of the requirements for completion for the IBM Data Science Professional Certification.
I enjoyed doing this project and I am glad to be considered as an IBM-certified Data Scientist ðŸ¤“
